Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Recruitment Central Program Expert position with the Illinois Department of Central Management Services. With over 20 years of experience in leadership roles spanning multiple industries, including significant experience in recruitment, team supervision, and professional development, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to your organization.

My background aligns perfectly with the key requirements of this position:

- **Team Leadership & Training:** As Team Leader for the R.I.G.H.T. Team at Vylla Home, I supervise a team of professionals, providing ongoing training, performance feedback, and career development. Previously, as Supervising Broker at GenStone Realty, I oversaw operations across two states, requiring adaptability and knowledge of different regulatory environments.

- **Recruitment & Retention:** In my current role as Admin for Central & Eastern Coast AVPs, I support 30 new agents through the onboarding process and have implemented successful retention initiatives. I've designed and managed comprehensive agent support systems that streamline recruitment workflows and enhance the employee experience.

- **Process Improvement:** I have consistently identified and implemented process improvements throughout my career, including a streamlined phone system that reduced AVP call volume by 90% and implementing efficiency systems for agent onboarding and license transfers.

- **Professional Organization Leadership:** My service on the Board of Directors for Lakes Area Realtors and as President of the Women's Council of Realtors demonstrates my commitment to leadership in professional settings and ability to work effectively with diverse stakeholders.

- **Customer Service & Communication:** My background in healthcare administration, including supervising front desk and call center operations, has honed my interpersonal skills and ability to provide excellent service in high-volume environments.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it combines my passion for helping people navigate career paths with my strengths in administrative leadership and process improvement. I believe my experience in multiple industries gives me a unique perspective on recruitment best practices that would benefit the Illinois Department of Central Management Services.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasm would be an asset to your team and contribute to the important work of the Bureau of Personnel.

Sincerely,

Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
