RE: Patient Service Representative - Immediate Care Center Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Part-Time Patient Service Representative position at Northwestern Medicine's Crystal Lake Immediate Care Center. With direct experience managing high-volume patient flow in medical settings, I am well-prepared for the role's 12-hour shifts and weekend/holiday coverage requirements.

My recent experience at Fox Lake Animal Hospital particularly aligns with your needs:
- Managed check-in/out for 60-80 patients daily in a fast-paced environment
- Processed patient registrations and verified demographic information
- Collected payments and managed end-of-day cash drawer reconciliation
- Maintained a clean and comfortable waiting area
- Demonstrated ability to handle medical emergencies while maintaining professional composure

Additionally, my role as Front Desk Supervisor at Midwest Sports Medicine involved:
- Verifying insurance and updating patient information
- Scheduling appointments and managing patient flow
- Processing payments and handling billing information
- Coordinating with medical staff to ensure efficient patient care

I understand the unique demands of immediate care settings and am comfortable with the position's scheduling requirements of two 12-hour shifts (7:45am-8:15pm) per week. My experience working in multiple healthcare facilities has prepared me for potential floating assignments to other clinics as needed.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my proven experience in medical office operations and patient service would benefit Northwestern Medicine's Immediate Care Center in Crystal Lake.

Sincerely,

Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
