RE: Patient Service Representative - Immediate Care Center Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Patient Service Representative position at Northwestern Medicine's Immediate Care Center in Crystal Lake. Drawing from my verifiable experience in healthcare administration, particularly my recent role at Fox Lake Animal Hospital where I managed patient flow of 60-80 patients daily, I offer directly relevant skills for this position.

My healthcare experience includes:

- Managing high-volume patient intake, triage, and scheduling at Fox Lake Animal Hospital and Midwest Sports Medicine
- Processing new patient paperwork, insurance verification, and maintaining accurate medical records in compliance with regulations
- Operating multi-line phone systems and healthcare scheduling software while providing exceptional customer service
- Coordinating with medical staff and handling patient payments and check-outs
- Demonstrated ability to manage emergency situations while maintaining professional composure

Additionally, my role as Supervisor of Front Desk and Call Center at Midwest Sports Medicine involved verifying insurance, scheduling appointments, and managing high-volume office operations, skills directly transferable to the Patient Service Representative position.

I am particularly drawn to Northwestern Medicine because of your commitment to patient care excellence. My experience in both human and veterinary healthcare settings has reinforced my understanding of the importance of compassionate, efficient patient service, especially in immediate care environments.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my proven experience in healthcare administration and patient service would benefit Northwestern Medicine's Immediate Care Center in Crystal Lake.

Sincerely,

Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
