# DX (Developer Experience) Audit Report — dzb-cv

_Audit Date: 2025-04-25_

## 1. Linting & Formatting

**Current Config:**
- ESLint: Strict, TypeScript-friendly config (`.eslintrc.cjs` with `@typescript-eslint/recommended`), project-rooted, covers TS and JS.
- `lint-staged` and Husky in `package.json` for staged file lint/format (but not wired to hooks currently).
- No standalone Prettier config file, but `prettier` is present and used in `lint-staged`.
- `.editorconfig` present for universal formatting.
- VSCode: Minimal extension recommendation.

**Strengths:**
- Good TS linting discipline.
- Codebase-wide formatting rules.
- Per-file staged lint/format is possible.

**Weaknesses:**
- Husky hooks aren't currently invoking linting/format scripts.
- Prettier settings (if not in package.json) default and opaque.
- VSCode settings don’t recommend/pre-configure ESLint or Prettier for in-editor fixes.

**Recommendations:**
- Add Husky pre-commit hook to run `lint-staged` for ESLint+Prettier on staged files.
- Add `.prettierrc` (or extend package.json) to document and control formatting choices explicitly.
- Update `.vscode/extensions.json` to recommend `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint` & `esbenp.prettier-vscode`.

**Note:** This `.prettierrc` file will be respected by supported IDEs (like VSCode/WebStorm) and the lint-staged process, guaranteeing uniform formatting local and pre-commit.

## 2. Type-Checking

**Current Config:**
- Extremely strict `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": true` and all best-practice error-surfacing flags.
- `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) available.

**Strengths:**
- Errors surfaced early by TypeScript.
- Separate test tsconfig for test-specific types.

**Weaknesses:**
- Type-check not wired into commit hooks.
- Type-check may be skipped by some devs if not integrated into pre-commit or editor save.

**Recommendations:**
- Add type-check to Husky pre-commit (`pnpm typecheck`).
- Confirm VSCode is using workspace TypeScript.

---

## 3. Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks

**Current Config:**
- `.husky/` exists, but current hooks only run Git LFS checks.
- `lint-staged` present in `package.json` but not invoked by hooks.
- No commit message linting.

**Strengths:**
- `lint-staged` mapping exists for targeted, fast pre-commit actions.

**Weaknesses:**
- Hooks missing code checks; code style, lint and types slip through to CI/build.

**Recommendations:**
- Add a Husky `pre-commit` that runs `pnpm lint-staged` (and `pnpm typecheck` if fast enough).
- Optional: Add Husky `pre-push` to run `pnpm test`.
- Add commit message linting with `commitlint` for Conventional Commits and semantic release if needed.

---

## 4. Test Feedback Loop

**Current Config:**
- Vitest with coverage (`text`, `json`, `html`), watch mode via separate scripts.
- Tests excluded from main tsconfig build, isolated in tests tsconfig.
- CI runs `pnpm test` on push/PR.

**Strengths:**
- Fast TS-native testing with coverage.
- Watch script for live feedback is available (`pnpm test:watch`).

**Weaknesses:**
- No pre-push test run locally; possible for broken tests to hit remote.
- IDE/test runner not recommended in VSCode settings.

**Recommendations:**
- Add Husky `pre-push` to run at least a subset or full `pnpm test`.
- Add badge for coverage in README.
- Suggest `vitest` plugin or configuration for VSCode.

---

## 5. Continuous Integration

**Current Config:**
- GitHub Actions: CI pipeline runs install, typecheck, test, lint, build.
- Multi-language `test.yml` for Node and Python, including coverage upload to Codecov.
- Good matrix config and caching.

**Strengths:**
- CI covers all major checks.
- Build blocked unless lint/type/test pass.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lint/test/type issues may be discovered only on remote if local hooks are skipped.
- No PR annotation for inline feedback on lint/tsc errors.

**Recommendations:**
- Add inline error annotations to GH Actions for lint/tsc errors (using actions problem matcher).
- Require all CI checks for PR merge (if not already enforced on repo).
- Add coverage, lint, and build status badges to README.

---

## 6. Editor & Developer UX

**Current Config:**
- `.editorconfig` ensures base text settings.
- `.vscode/extensions.json` recommends only one extension.

**Strengths:**
- Consistent cross-editor base formatting.

**Weaknesses:**
- No active Prettier or ESLint extension recommended.
- No settings for format on save/lint on save.
- No tasks/launch configs for tests.

**Recommendations:**
- Recommend ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest extensions in `.vscode/extensions.json`.
- Add `.vscode/settings.json` keys for format on save, eslint.validate languages, and default formatter.
- Optionally, provide VSCode tasks/launch configs for debugging tests or running `dev`.

---

## 7. Documentation & Automation

**Current Config:**
- No detected `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- README present.
- Scripts are present and comprehensive in `package.json`.

**Strengths:**
- Many automation scripts already available for common workflows.

**Weaknesses:**
- No onboarding/docs for contributing, commit conventions, or toolchain setup.
- No README badges for CI, coverage, or lint status.

**Recommendations:**
- Add `CONTRIBUTING.md` with setup, commit, and code quality guidance.
- Update README with toolchain, scripts, and badges for CI, coverage, lint.
- Document Volta-pinned toolchain (Node, PNPM, Yarn, Ruby if applicable).

---

## High-Leverage Improvement Summary

1. **Wire up Husky hooks:** Add pre-commit for lint-staged+typecheck, pre-push for full tests, commit-msg linting.
2. **Editor config enhancements:** Recommend/auto-install lint/format/test extensions and format on save.
3. **Explicit Prettier config:** Add `.prettierrc` for unified formatting.
4. **Inline GitHub Actions problem matchers:** Add PR annotations for fast feedback.
5. **Docs + task badges:** Quickstart, commit, and badge-centric `README`/`CONTRIBUTING`.
6. **Badge status:** Visual clarity and pride in CI/lint/coverage health.

Following these actions will ensure most errors and style issues are visible immediately during development, pre-commit, or at worst during PR/CI—drastically improving velocity, pride, and code quality.
