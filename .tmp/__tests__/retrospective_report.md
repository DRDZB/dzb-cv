# DZB-CV Project Retrospective – Error Recovery & Status (April 24, 2025)

## 1. Failures/Issues and How Discovered

**A. Automated Testing Failures & Coverage Gaps**
- ATS optimization system introduced significant content parsing changes, causing legacy test failures.
- Issues detected included improper date handling, section heading mismatches, and problematic ATS scoring for certain templates (cli_history.txt:84-132, last_commits.txt:39-2210).
- Edge cases, such as empty/long/problematic CV content or unrecognized section headers, failed to yield reliable ATS scores (cli_history.txt:38-80, last_commits.txt:1163-1806).
- Test output and shell history confirm repeat execution of `npm test src/__tests__/generator.test.ts`, indicating initial failures were encountered and required iterative fixes (cli_history.txt:144-152).

**B. Data Verification and Content Consistency**
- Some experiences lacked proper date format or start date, resulting in missing or ambiguous periods in rendered CVs. This was detected by `analyzeATSCompatibility` checks and template tests (last_commits.txt:1545-2196, cli_history.txt:38-81).
- The README and AGENT documentation strictly require all experience claims be verified against base-info.json and all generated content to link directly to source data, with no interpolation or unverifiable data permitted (README.md:34-38, 81-85), but coverage gaps and failures to detect these in prior logic or tests were identified.

**C. Documentation/Process Gaps and Application Log TODOs**
- Some follow-up items and job application tasks remained open in agent-comments.md, such as unsent thank you emails, missing application confirmation archiving, and pending research ahead of interviews (agent-comments.md:78-88, 123-127, 192-201).
- Explicit "Improvements Identified" in `runs/nm-crystal-lake-psr-2025-04-24.md` called out missing features (e.g., custom filename support in CLI, improved healthcare templates, better PDF-gen from markdown), indicating known shortcomings in user workflow and output flexibility (runlog.md:26-33).

## 2. Error Recovery & Mitigation

**A. Targeted Patches and Testing Enhancements**
- A dedicated fix commit improved ATS analysis and testing, explicitly addressing date handling, adjusted scoring, enhanced template structure, and expanded edge case coverage. All integration and compatibility tests were updated to match new ATS expectations (cli_history.txt:90-132; last_commits.txt:623896a, diff for src/utils/ats/analyzer.ts, src/__tests__/ats-compatibility.test.ts, src/__tests__/ats-integration.test.ts).
- Follow-up test runs (`pnpm test && ...`) after patches verified that initial failures were resolved; successful iteration is implied by absence of further failed runs and subsequent commit/push activity in shell history (cli_history.txt:141, 149).
- Substantial review and rationalization of impact scores, error messages, and mitigation logic in `analyzeATSCompatibility` and the optimizer, reducing false negatives for valid edge cases and yielding actionable improvement suggestions (last_commits.txt:542-725, 1513-1825).

**B. Template & PDF Generation Rework**
- Rewrote helper utilities for date formatting, period parsing, experience sorting to ensure all content is strictly verified and periods are never missing or ambiguous (last_commits.txt:723-1061, 3174-3679).
- Implemented and documented a hierarchy of PDF generators, with clear separation between ATS-standard processes and custom formats, in accordance with best practices (README.md:56-67).
- Added or updated test cases for federal, state, and private templates, including explicit Handlebars helpers for consistent, validated output (last_commits.txt:3184-3538).

**C. Documentation and User/Agent Guidance**
- Comprehensive documentation restructure: clarified data verification requirements, application process, and improvement workflow in README and AGENT.md, reaffirming "single source of truth" and best practices for content generation, testing, and recovery (README.md:31-112, last_commits.txt:3978).
- Retained a robust strategy and recovery log in agent-comments.md, with explicit follow-ups and contextual notes for each application (agent-comments.md:78-201).

## 3. Next Actions (Technical & Process)

**A. Technical Improvements**
1. **Implement Custom Filename Support for CLI**  
   Users have requested flexible filename output for easier archiving and traceability (runlog.md:26).
2. **Continue to Enhance PDF Generation Fidelity**
   - Further improve markdown-to-PDF pipeline and ensure ATS-optimized templates accurately reflect healthcare scenarios (runlog.md:27, 31).
   - Complete implementation of healthcare-specific CV template and update integration points (runlog.md:31, 43).

3. **Expand Test Coverage**
   - Add targeted tests for any remaining edge cases (especially for healthcare/flexible jobs).
   - Continuously validate experience sorting and date formatting across templates as required by testing gaps previously found (last_commits.txt:3174-3538).
   - Enforce that all information rendered in outputs is verified and never interpolated without provenance (README.md:34-38, 69-85).

**B. Process-Oriented Actions**
1. **Close Open Application Follow-ups**
   - Complete all unchecked actions in agent-comments.md for each job (send confirmations, thank you notes, research for interviews, follow-ups) (agent-comments.md:78-88, 123-127, 192-201).
   - Schedule explicit review sessions to verify follow-ups have been actioned in real time.

2. **Formalize Error Recovery Protocol**
   - Integrate a checklist before each major commit/push, requiring test green-light, confirmation of no unaddressed agent/application TODOs, and adherence to data verification requirements (README.md:96-112).
   - Maintain detailed context and verification in each application run log in the `runs/` directory (README.md:109-111).

3. **Update & Monitor Documentation**
   - Ensure all technical/user documentation is current and covers new CLI/PDF/test functionality.
   - Continue to document improvement ideas and technical challenges for each run, as per the process documented in README (README.md:113-119).
