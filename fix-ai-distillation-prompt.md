# Fix for AI Distillation Header-Without-Content Issue

## Problem Identified
The AI workflow is creating section headers like "üí™ CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES" but then omitting the actual content underneath. This creates unprofessional-looking CVs with orphaned headers.

## Root Cause
The current distillation prompt in `OpenAIClient.ts` (line 217-226) doesn't explicitly prevent this issue:

```typescript
return `Please distill the following CV into a concise, single-page format (approximately ${maxLength} characters).

Requirements:
- Maintain the most impactful information
- Keep it ${style} in tone
- Preserve key achievements and skills
- Ensure readability and flow
- Focus on results and quantifiable accomplishments

Original CV:\n\n${cvText}`;
```

## Solution: Enhanced Distillation Prompt

The prompt should be updated to:

```typescript
return `Please distill the following CV into a concise, single-page format (approximately ${maxLength} characters).

Requirements:
- Maintain the most impactful information
- Keep it ${style} in tone
- Preserve key achievements and skills
- Ensure readability and flow
- Focus on results and quantifiable accomplishments

CRITICAL RULE: Never include a section header without content beneath it. 
If you cannot include meaningful content for a section, omit the entire section including its header.
Each section must have substantial content - do not create empty or near-empty sections.

Examples of what NOT to do:
‚ùå ## CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES
    [empty or just one line]

Examples of what TO do:
‚úÖ ## CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES
    ‚Ä¢ Patient Care Excellence: 40+ years direct patient interaction, HIPAA compliance
    ‚Ä¢ Medical Administration: Insurance verification, appointment scheduling, billing
    ‚Ä¢ Technical Proficiency: EHR systems, healthcare databases, scheduling software

OR completely omit the section if there isn't room for meaningful content.

Original CV:\n\n${cvText}`;
```

## Implementation Location
File: `/Users/scottybe/Development/tools/Workspace/dzb-cv/src/core/services/llm/OpenAIClient.ts`
Method: `buildDistillationPrompt()` (around line 214)

## Additional Validation
The system should also validate the AI output to detect and fix orphaned headers:

```typescript
function validateAndFixOrphanedHeaders(content: string): string {
  const lines = content.split('\n');
  const fixedLines: string[] = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    const line = lines[i];
    
    // Check if this is a header (starts with # or ##)
    if (line.match(/^#+\s/)) {
      // Look ahead to see if there's meaningful content
      let hasContent = false;
      for (let j = i + 1; j < lines.length && j < i + 5; j++) {
        const nextLine = lines[j];
        if (nextLine.trim() && !nextLine.match(/^#+\s/)) {
          // Found non-header content
          if (nextLine.length > 10) { // Meaningful content threshold
            hasContent = true;
            break;
          }
        }
        if (nextLine.match(/^#+\s/)) break; // Hit another header
      }
      
      // Only include header if it has meaningful content
      if (hasContent) {
        fixedLines.push(line);
      }
    } else {
      fixedLines.push(line);
    }
  }
  
  return fixedLines.join('\n');
}
```

This fix ensures that the AI workflow produces professional CVs without orphaned section headers.
