## 2025-08-01 â€” ðŸ”§ ATS System Architecture Refactor

**Milestone:**  
Major refactoring of ATS (Applicant Tracking System) functionality with enhanced configurability and improved architecture.

**Features:**
- Created `BaseCVAnalyzer` abstract class eliminating code duplication between analyzers
- Enhanced `ScoringEngine` with customizable weights via `ScoringCriteria` interface
- Improved `SkillMatcher` with fuzzy logic support and configurable similarity thresholds
- Introduced `ExtendedScoringCriteria` with fuzzy matching configuration options
- Added configurable analyzer options through `AnalyzerOptions` interface
- Refactored both Classic and TF-IDF analyzers to extend unified base class
- Maintained full backward compatibility for all existing APIs

**Technical Implementation:**
- Consolidated shared functionality in `BaseCVAnalyzer` abstract base class
- Enhanced scoring algorithms with better normalization and configurability
- Added fuzzy matching with configurable similarity thresholds for skill detection
- Improved skill matching accuracy with comprehensive alias support
- Comprehensive test coverage maintained (243 tests passing, no regressions)
- Enhanced error handling and input validation across all components

**Benefits:**
- More maintainable and extensible codebase with better separation of concerns
- Configurable analysis options for different use cases and requirements
- Enhanced fuzzy matching capabilities for improved skill and keyword detection
- Better performance through shared logic and optimized algorithms
- Zero breaking changes - existing consumer code continues to work unchanged

**Use Cases:**
- Custom ATS analysis with tailored scoring weights
- Enhanced skill matching for specialized industries
- Configurable fuzzy matching for improved keyword detection
- Extensible architecture for custom analyzer implementations

## 2025-08-01 â€” ðŸ“„ Single-Page PDF Generation Feature

**Milestone:**  
Implemented comprehensive single-page PDF generation capability for compact CV presentation.

**Features:**
- Added `--single-page` CLI flag for optimized compact formatting
- Enhanced PDF generators (pdf-lib and puppeteer) with single-page layout algorithms
- Optimized font sizing and spacing for maximum content density on single page
- Comprehensive test coverage with 382 new test cases for single-page functionality
- Updated CLI to support sector-specific single-page generation (federal, state, private)
- Improved content optimization algorithms for space-constrained layouts
- Added guidance documentation for when to use single-page vs two-page formats

**Use Cases:**
- Entry-level positions (0-5 years experience)
- Career changers requiring focused presentation
- Initial screening processes where brevity is valued
- Positions requiring concise, scannable format

**Technical Implementation:**
- New single-page layout engine with intelligent content fitting
- Enhanced type definitions for single-page PDF options
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Performance optimizations for single-page rendering

## 2025-04-25 â€” ðŸš€ Foreman's Master Blueprint v0.1 & Initial Meta-Agent OSS Bootstrapped

**Milestone:**  
Formal adoption of "Foreman's Master Blueprint v0.1" and delivery of first operational, agent-driven build system.

**Highlights:**
- Formal "constitution" for agent-driven meta-architecture committed as blueprint.md.
- System bootstrap and agent scaffolding (Construction Foreman + builder agents) completed.
- SDK-compliant tool wrapping (extract_text, preprocess_text, parsing, scoring).
- Plaintext parsing pipeline demo successfully ran; outputs structured resume data from samples/.
- Project layout, memory conventions, agent roles, and all file system structure ratified and live.
- Ready for future agent coordination, memory evolution, and workflow automation!

## 2025-06-XX â€” ðŸ“š Documentation Consolidation & Modernization

**Milestone:**
Unified and modernized all project documentation for clarity, maintainability, and discoverability.

**Highlights:**
- Merged modernization, roadmap, and audit docs into `Project-History-Roadmap.md`
- Consolidated architecture docs into `technical/System-Architecture.md`
- Unified DX audit and maintenance docs into `technical/Developer-Experience.md`
- Combined process docs into `Application-Customization-Process.md`
- Created a single `reference/Reference.md` for CLI, API, and config reference
- Consolidated all example guides into `examples/README.md`
- Updated `docs/README.md` to reflect the new structure and canonical entry points
- Removed outdated, redundant, and placeholder files

**Benefits:**
- Easier onboarding and navigation for contributors and users
- Single source of truth for each major documentation area
- Reduced duplication and maintenance overhead
- Clearer links between user, technical, and reference docs
