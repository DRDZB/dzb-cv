# DX (Developer Experience) Audit Report — dzb-cv

_Audit Date: 2024-03-27_

## 1. Linting & Formatting

**Current Config:**
- ESLint: Strict, TypeScript-friendly config (`.eslintrc.cjs` with `@typescript-eslint/recommended`), project-rooted, covers TS and JS.
- `lint-staged` and Husky in `package.json` for staged file lint/format.
- Explicit Prettier config in `.prettierrc` with well-defined formatting rules.
- `.editorconfig` present for universal formatting.
- VSCode: Comprehensive extension recommendations including ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest.

**Strengths:**
- Good TS linting discipline.
- Codebase-wide formatting rules.
- Per-file staged lint/format is possible.
- Explicit Prettier configuration with documented rules.
- VSCode integration for linting and formatting.

---

## 2. Type-Checking

**Current Config:**
- Extremely strict `tsconfig.json` with `"strict": true` and all best-practice error-surfacing flags.
- `pnpm typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) available.
- VSCode configured to use workspace TypeScript.

**Strengths:**
- Errors surfaced early by TypeScript.
- Separate test tsconfig for test-specific types.
- IDE integration for immediate type feedback.

## 3. Pre-commit/Pre-push Hooks

**Current Config:**


**Strengths:**

**Weaknesses:**

**Recommendations:**

---

## 4. Test Feedback Loop

**Current Config:**
- Vitest with coverage (`text`, `json`, `html`), watch mode via separate scripts.
- Tests excluded from main tsconfig build, isolated in tests tsconfig.
- CI runs `pnpm test` on push/PR.
- VSCode Vitest extension recommended.

**Strengths:**
- Fast TS-native testing with coverage.
- Watch script for live feedback (`pnpm test:watch`).
- IDE integration for test running and debugging.
- UI test explorer available (`pnpm test:ui`).

**Weaknesses:**
- No pre-push test run locally; possible for broken tests to hit remote.

**Recommendations:**
- Add badge for coverage in README.

---

## 5. Continuous Integration

**Current Config:**
- GitHub Actions: CI pipeline runs install, typecheck, test, lint, build.
- Multi-language `test.yml` for Node and Python, including coverage upload to Codecov.
- Good matrix config and caching.

**Strengths:**
- CI covers all major checks.
- Build blocked unless lint/type/test pass.

**Weaknesses:**
- Lint/test/type issues may be discovered only on remote if local hooks are skipped.
- No PR annotation for inline feedback on lint/tsc errors.

**Recommendations:**
- Add inline error annotations to GH Actions for lint/tsc errors (using actions problem matcher).
- Require all CI checks for PR merge (if not already enforced on repo).
- Add coverage, lint, and build status badges to README.

---

## 6. Editor & Developer UX

**Current Config:**
- `.editorconfig` ensures base text settings.
- `.vscode/extensions.json` recommends ESLint, Prettier, and Vitest extensions.
- Volta pinned Node and PNPM versions.

**Strengths:**
- Consistent cross-editor base formatting.
- Comprehensive IDE tooling recommendations.
- Locked toolchain versions.

**Weaknesses:**
- No settings for format on save/lint on save.
- No tasks/launch configs for tests.

**Recommendations:**
- Add `.vscode/settings.json` keys for format on save, eslint.validate languages, and default formatter.
- Provide VSCode tasks/launch configs for debugging tests or running `dev`.

---

## 7. Documentation & Automation

**Current Config:**
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` present.
- README present.
- Comprehensive scripts in `package.json`.
- Volta-pinned toolchain.

**Strengths:**
- Many automation scripts available for common workflows.
- Documented Node/PNPM version requirements.
- Contributing guidelines established.

**Weaknesses:**
- No README badges for CI, coverage, or lint status.
- Setup documentation could be enhanced.

**Recommendations:**
- Update README with badges for CI, coverage, lint.
- Enhance setup documentation with step-by-step guide.

## High-Leverage Improvement Summary

1. **Wire up Husky hooks:** Add pre-commit for lint-staged+typecheck, pre-push for full tests.
2. **VSCode settings:** Add format/lint on save configuration.
3. **GitHub Actions enhancements:** Add PR annotations for fast feedback.
4. **Badge status:** Add visual clarity with CI/lint/coverage badges.
5. **Setup documentation:** Enhance onboarding experience with detailed setup guide.

Following these actions will ensure most errors and style issues are visible immediately during development, pre-commit, or at worst during PR/CI—drastically improving velocity, pride, and code quality.
