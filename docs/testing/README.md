# Testing Guidelines

## Overview
This document outlines the testing strategies, frameworks, and conventions used in the DZB-CV project. These guidelines help ensure high-quality code and reliable functionality.

## Testing Framework

- **Jest**: Used for unit and integration tests.
- **Cypress**: Utilized for end-to-end testing.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier**: For static code analysis and formatting checks.

## Test Structure

- **Unit Tests**: Located in the `/tests/unit/` directory. Focus on testing individual components or functions.
  - Naming convention: `ComponentName.test.ts`
- **Integration Tests**: Located in the `/tests/integration/` directory. Test interactions between components.
  - Naming convention: `FeatureName.integration.test.ts`
- **End-to-End Tests**: Written in Cypress and stored in `/tests/e2e/`.
  - Typical filenames: `E2EFeatureName.cy.js`
  
## Running Tests
Use the following commands to execute tests:

```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run all integration tests
npm run test:integrate

# Run all end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

## Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Ensure unit tests do not depend on external services. Use mock data and dependencies.
2. **Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage, especially in critical areas like business logic and data validation.
3. **Descriptive Naming**: Use clear and descriptive names for test cases.
4. **Consistent Style**: Follow code formatting and style guidelines as enforced by ESLint and Prettier.

## Continuous Integration

- **CI Pipelines**: Tests are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.
- **Reporting**: Test results and coverage reports are generated and uploaded for analysis.

This document is crucial for maintaining testing standard practices and should be updated with any testing strategy changes.
