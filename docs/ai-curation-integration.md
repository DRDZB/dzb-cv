# AI Content Curation System Integration

## Overview

The AI Content Curation System has been successfully integrated into the DZB-CV project. This system provides intelligent content selection and optimization for one-page CV generation based on job requirements and application context.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Content Analysis Engine** (`packages/ai-curation/src/analysis/content-analyzer.ts`)
   - Parses all CV sections and extracts content items
   - Analyzes impact, recency, relevance, and sector alignment
   - Identifies content clusters and themes

2. **Job Alignment Scorer** (`packages/ai-curation/src/scoring/job-alignment-scorer.ts`)
   - Evaluates content relevance against job requirements
   - Scores keyword matching, skill alignment, and experience relevance
   - Applies recency and impact factors

3. **Content Priority Ranker** (`packages/ai-curation/src/ranking/content-ranker.ts`)
   - Ranks content items using strategic importance
   - Applies length and content type constraints
   - Generates inclusion/exclusion decisions with modifications

4. **Intelligent Content Curator** (`packages/ai-curation/src/agent/content-curator.ts`)
   - Orchestrates the complete curation process
   - Applies sector-specific optimization strategies
   - Generates curated CV content optimized for target audience

### Integration Points

#### CLI Integration

The AI curation system has been integrated with existing CLI commands:

**AI Generate Command** (`src/cli/commands/ai-generate.ts`):
```bash
cv ai-generate -n "John Doe" -e "john@example.com" \
  --job-description "Senior Developer position..." \
  --target-sector tech \
  --style professional
```

**Generate CV Command** (`src/cli/commands/generate-cv.ts`):
```bash
cv generate federal --ai-optimize \
  --job-url "https://usajobs.gov/job/123" \
  --style executive \
  --disable-curation
```

#### AI Generator Integration

The existing AI generator (`src/shared/tools/ai-generator.ts`) has been enhanced with:
- Intelligent content curation options
- Job-targeted CV generation
- Sector-specific optimization
- Context-aware content selection

## Features

### Intelligent Content Selection

- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Understands job requirements and tailors content accordingly
- **Sector Optimization**: Federal, healthcare, tech, and private sector specializations  
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring including keywords, skills, experience, recency
- **Length Optimization**: Ensures single-page constraint while maximizing impact

### Curation Strategies

- **Default Strategy**: Balanced approach for general applications
- **Federal Strategy**: Compliance-focused with detailed achievements
- **Healthcare Strategy**: Patient care and regulatory emphasis
- **Tech Strategy**: Innovation and technical skills prioritized

### Content Transformations

- **Shortening**: Automatically condenses verbose content
- **Emphasis**: Highlights relevant keywords and achievements
- **Reordering**: Prioritizes most relevant experiences first
- **Optimization**: Removes redundant or low-impact content

## Usage Examples

### Basic AI-Optimized CV Generation

```bash
# Generate AI-optimized CV with job description
cv ai-generate -n "Jane Smith" -e "jane@example.com" \
  --job-description "We seek a React developer with 5+ years experience..."

# Generate with job URL (future enhancement)
cv ai-generate -n "Jane Smith" -e "jane@example.com" \
  --job-url "https://company.com/careers/senior-developer"
```

### Sector-Specific Generation with AI

```bash
# Federal position with AI optimization
cv generate federal --ai-optimize \
  --job-description "GS-13 Software Developer position..."

# Healthcare position with curation
cv generate healthcare --ai-optimize \
  --target-sector healthcare \
  --style professional
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Disable curation for manual control
cv generate tech --ai-optimize --disable-curation

# Target specific sector override
cv generate private --ai-optimize --target-sector tech
```

## Configuration

### Default AI Agent Configuration

```typescript
const defaultCuratorConfig = {
  defaultStrategy: {
    name: 'balanced',
    constraints: {
      maxCharacters: 4500,
      maxExperienceItems: 4,
      maxEducationItems: 2,
      maxSkills: 12
    },
    weights: {
      keywordRelevance: 0.3,
      skillAlignment: 0.2,
      experienceRelevance: 0.2,
      recencyScore: 0.1,
      impactScore: 0.1,
      sectorRelevance: 0.1
