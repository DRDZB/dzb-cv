Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Medical Cash Poster position at Ignite Team Partners. With over 15 years of experience in healthcare administration, patient account management, and financial operations, I am confident in my ability to contribute to your team with accuracy, efficiency, and professionalism.

In my previous roles, I have:
- Accurately posted and reconciled cash, checks, and electronic payments
- Managed daily batch deposits and supported month-end closing processes
- Maintained strict confidentiality and ensured HIPAA compliance in all patient records and transactions
- Demonstrated advanced proficiency in Microsoft Office, especially Excel, for financial tracking and reporting
- Assisted in cross-training and supported team members in dynamic, high-volume environments

My experience as a Front Desk Assistant at Fox Lake Animal Hospital and as a Supervisor at Midwest Sports Medicine has equipped me with the organizational skills, attention to detail, and problem-solving abilities required for this role. I am adept at balancing multiple priorities, working independently, and collaborating with colleagues to achieve departmental goals.

I am particularly drawn to Ignite Team Partners' commitment to excellence and teamwork. I am eager to bring my skills in cash posting, A/R management, and healthcare administration to your organization.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills align with the needs of your team.
