# Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the part-time Medical Laboratory Scientist/Medical Laboratory Technician position at Mercyhealth Hospital and Medical Center-Harvard. As a Harvard resident with extensive experience in healthcare operations and laboratory support, I am particularly interested in the day shift schedule (40 hours/2 weeks) that would allow me to contribute to my local community's healthcare system while pursuing my educational goals in medical laboratory science.

In my current role as Front Desk/Veterinary Assistant at Fox Lake Animal Hospital, I manage complex medical documentation and laboratory coordination while handling 60-80 daily patient interactions. This experience has honed my attention to detail, accuracy in record-keeping, and ability to maintain high standards in a fast-paced medical environment - skills that are directly applicable to clinical laboratory procedures in hematology, urinalysis, chemistry, and blood bank testing.

My career has been built on a foundation of:
- Ensuring precise documentation and record-keeping in medical settings
- Coordinating with laboratory and pharmacy operations
- Maintaining strict compliance with medical regulations and procedures
- Managing medical equipment preparation and sterilization
- Implementing efficient processes for high-volume operations
- Building strong relationships with healthcare professionals

At Northwest Oncology and Hematology, I managed medical records and coordinated with laboratory services for chemotherapy patients, developing strong skills in precise documentation and attention to detail. As a Certified Pharmacy Technician at Osco Pharmacy, I gained valuable experience in medication inventory management and quality control - skills that demonstrate my ability to maintain the high standards of accuracy required in laboratory work.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity because it represents the perfect alignment of my career goals and educational aspirations. I am actively researching medical laboratory certification programs and professional development opportunities in laboratory science, making Mercyhealth's educational assistance programs especially appealing. As a Harvard resident, I understand the vital role Mercyhealth plays in our area's healthcare system, and I am eager to grow both professionally and academically while serving our local community. The part-time schedule would provide the ideal balance for pursuing further education while gaining hands-on laboratory experience.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills, experience, and educational goals can contribute to the success of your laboratory team. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
