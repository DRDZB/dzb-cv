RE: Application for Patient Access Supervisor Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Patient Access Supervisor position at Mercyhealth. With over 40 years of experience in customer service, healthcare and administration, including direct supervision of front desk and call center operations, I offer a strong foundation in the core competencies required for this role.




- **Patient Access & Registration**: At Fox Lake Animal Hospital, I managed high-volume patient flow (60-80/day), coordinated scheduling, and ensured accurate intake documentation. My expertise in patient registration and flow management aligns with your need to monitor "scheduling functions, provider templates" and make "recommendations on template changes to best utilize providers' time."

I am particularly drawn to this position at Mercyhealth because of your organization's reputation for excellence in patient care and your commitment to operational efficiency. I am confident that my skills in team leadership, process improvement, and healthcare administration would enable me to make meaningful contributions to your Patient Access department.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills would benefit Mercyhealth and contribute to your mission of providing exceptional patient care.

Sincerely,

Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
