RE: Application for Patient Access Supervisor Position

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Patient Access Supervisor position at Mercyhealth. With over 40 years of experience in customer service and healthcare administration, including direct supervision of front desk and call center operations, I offer a strong foundation in the core competencies required for this role.

My professional background includes extensive experience in patient scheduling, insurance verification, staff training, and process improvement, which directly relates to the qualifications you are seeking. During my tenure at Midwest Sports Medicine, I supervised front desk operations and a call center, managed high-volume patient scheduling, verified insurance coverage, and implemented training programs that significantly improved operational efficiency. My experience aligns exceptionally well with your requirements in the following ways:

- **Staff Supervision & Development**: At Midwest Sports Medicine, I successfully managed a team of front desk and call center staff, implemented performance improvement processes, and developed comprehensive training programs for new employees. This experience directly relates to your need for a supervisor who can "provide orientation and training to new hires" and "conduct team meetings to apprise staff of changes."

- **Revenue Cycle & Insurance Processes**: Throughout my healthcare career, I have maintained a thorough understanding of insurance verification, authorization requirements, and claim submission processes. I have experience "monitoring the accuracy of data entry of demographic and insurance information" and ensuring "adherence to access and financial policies/procedures" as specified in your job description.

- **Process Improvement & Policy Implementation**: I have consistently identified opportunities for workflow enhancement, including implementing verification protocols that reduced scheduling errors by 35% at Midwest Sports Medicine. This experience will be valuable in your requirement to "develop, recommend and implement policies and procedures for the department."

- **Patient Access & Registration**: At Fox Lake Animal Hospital, I managed high-volume patient flow (60-80/day), coordinated scheduling, and ensured accurate intake documentation. My expertise in patient registration and flow management aligns with your need to monitor "scheduling functions, provider templates" and make "recommendations on template changes to best utilize providers' time."

I am particularly drawn to this position at Mercyhealth because of your organization's reputation for excellence in patient care and your commitment to operational efficiency. I am confident that my skills in team leadership, process improvement, and healthcare administration would enable me to make meaningful contributions to your Patient Access department.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills would benefit Mercyhealth and contribute to your mission of providing exceptional patient care.

Sincerely,

Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
