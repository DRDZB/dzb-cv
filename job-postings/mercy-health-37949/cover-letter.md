Hiring Manager  
Mercyhealth Crystal Lake Hospital  
875 S Route 31  
Crystal Lake, IL 60014

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Patient Access Supervisor position at Mercyhealth Crystal Lake Hospital. With over 15 years of combined experience in healthcare administration, team leadership, and revenue cycle operations, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your organization's patient access management team.

In my most recent role as Front Desk/Veterinary Assistant at Fox Lake Animal Hospital, I successfully managed a high-volume patient flow of 60-80 patients daily, implementing efficient triage protocols and scheduling systems. This experience directly aligns with the requirements of the Patient Access Supervisor position, particularly in managing patient flow, coordinating with clinical staff, and ensuring compliance with healthcare regulations.

My background includes extensive experience in:
- Supervising and training staff in healthcare settings, including conducting performance reviews and providing coaching
- Managing patient registration and scheduling systems, with a focus on accuracy and efficiency
- Implementing and monitoring compliance with healthcare regulations, including HIPAA and CMS standards
- Coordinating with multiple departments to optimize patient care and workflow
- Handling insurance verification and claims processing, ensuring maximum reimbursement
- Developing and implementing efficient workflows and process improvements

As a Licensed Managing Broker at Vylla, I led a team of 4 professionals across Illinois and Wisconsin, developing training programs and implementing performance management systems. This experience has honed my ability to effectively supervise teams, implement policies, and ensure operational efficiency - skills that are directly transferable to the Patient Access Supervisor role.

I am particularly drawn to Mercyhealth's commitment to excellence in patient care and its focus on maintaining high standards in healthcare operations. My experience in implementing efficient workflows and maintaining compliance with healthcare regulations aligns perfectly with Mercyhealth's mission and values. I am confident that my combination of healthcare administration experience and team leadership skills makes me an ideal candidate for this position.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to the success of your patient access management team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Mercyhealth's continued success.

Sincerely,

Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
