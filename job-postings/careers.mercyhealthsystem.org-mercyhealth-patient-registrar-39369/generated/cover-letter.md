My background also includes valuable experience as a Supervisor of Front Desk, Call Center, and MRI Scheduling at Midwest Sports Medicine, where I developed strong skills in healthcare operations and patient access management. Additionally, my recent role as Admin for Central & Eastern Coast AVPs at Vylla has further enhanced my abilities in handling high-volume communications and coordinating cross-functional activities.

I am particularly drawn to Mercyhealth's commitment to excellence in patient care and service.
