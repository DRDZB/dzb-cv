Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Patient Access Lead position at Mercyhealth's Javon Bea Hospital-Riverside in Rockford. With extensive experience in healthcare administration and team leadership, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Mercyhealth's mission of delivering exceptional patient care. I am particularly interested in the second shift schedule (80 hours/2 weeks) and find the compensation range of $23.18-$34.78/hour commensurate with my experience and the role's responsibilities.

My background directly aligns with the key requirements of this position:

- **Patient Access Operations**: At Fox Lake Animal Hospital and Midwest Sports Medicine, I managed high-volume patient flow (60-80/day), coordinating efficient intake processes while maintaining strict documentation standards. My experience includes insurance verification, payment processing, and implementing workflow improvements that enhanced both efficiency and patient satisfaction.

- **Leadership & Team Development**: As a Supervisor at Midwest Sports Medicine, I led front desk and call center operations, providing comprehensive staff training and performance evaluation. I understand the importance of maintaining consistent service standards while adapting to changing healthcare requirements.

- **Process Improvement & Compliance**: Throughout my career, I have demonstrated success in developing and implementing improved workflows, maintaining regulatory compliance, and ensuring accurate documentation. I am experienced in coordinating across departments and adapting quickly to new healthcare management systems.

What particularly draws me to this role is the opportunity to combine my healthcare administration expertise with team leadership in a dynamic hospital environment. I am confident that my experience in supervising front desk operations, managing patient access workflows, and maintaining high standards of service would be valuable assets to Mercyhealth. I am also committed to obtaining the required healthcare revenue cycle certification within the first year of employment.

I am excited about the prospect of joining Mercyhealth and contributing to the success of the Patient Access team. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to discussing how my skills and experience align with your needs.

Sincerely,  
Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
