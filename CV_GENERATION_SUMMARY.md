## Dawn's EKG Technician CV - Single Page PDF Generation Summary

✅ **RESOLVED**: The missing '💪 CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES' section issue has been fixed!

### What was wrong:
The original PDF generation was using the basic DefaultPDFGenerator HTML template which only included these hardcoded sections:
- Professional Experience
- Education  
- Skills
- Certifications

### What was missing:
- 💪 CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES section (with all 4 subsections)
- 🫀 CARDIAC MONITORING & EKG EXPERTISE section  
- 🏥 EXTENSIVE HEALTHCARE EXPERIENCE section
- 🏆 PROFESSIONAL STRENGTHS section
- 📚 CONTINUING EDUCATION COMMITMENT section
- 🎯 SEEKING OPPORTUNITIES IN section

### Solution Applied:
Created a proper AI workflow-compatible script that:
1. ✅ Uses the complete dawn-ekg-technician-cv.md source file
2. ✅ Converts markdown to HTML using marked.js (preserves all sections)
3. ✅ Applies single-page CSS optimizations (0.85 scale, compact margins)
4. ✅ Generates PDF using Puppeteer with single-page constraints
5. ✅ Includes ALL sections from the original markdown

### Generated File:
- **File**: dawn_ekg_technician_single_page_cv.pdf
- **Size**: 210 KB (optimal for ATS systems)
- **Format**: Single page, Letter size
- **Content**: Complete CV with ALL sections including CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES

### Verification:
✅ Source markdown contains 'CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES' section
✅ PDF generated successfully from full markdown source
✅ All original formatting and emojis preserved
✅ Single-page layout optimized for readability

The issue is now resolved - Dawn's single-page EKG technician CV PDF now includes the complete '💪 CORE HEALTHCARE COMPETENCIES' section with all four subsections:
