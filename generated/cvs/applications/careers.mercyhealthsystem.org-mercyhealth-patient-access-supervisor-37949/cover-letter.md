- Implementing efficient processes that improve service delivery and operational effectiveness
- Developing strong relationships with clients, staff, and stakeholders
- Identifying challenges and implementing practical solutions
- Coordinating cross-functional operations to achieve organizational goals

As a Licensed Managing Broker at Vylla, I built and led a team of 4 professionals across Illinois and Wisconsin, developing comprehensive training programs and implementing innovative solutions to improve team efficiency. This experience has honed my ability to effectively lead teams, optimize processes, and deliver exceptional service - skills that are directly transferable to the Patient Access Supervisor role.

I am particularly drawn to Mercyhealth's commitment to excellence in patient care and its focus on maintaining high standards in healthcare operations.
