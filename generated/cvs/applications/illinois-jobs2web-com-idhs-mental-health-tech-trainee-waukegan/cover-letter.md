Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Mental Health Technician Trainee position at the Kiley Developmental Center. With a background in direct care, patient support, and healthcare administration, I am passionate about providing compassionate, high-quality care to individuals with developmental disabilities.

In my previous roles, I have:
- Assisted with personal care, hygiene, and daily living activities
- Supported individuals in becoming more independent and confident
- Documented care, observed behavior, and communicated changes to the care team
- Helped maintain a safe, clean, and supportive environment
- Worked collaboratively with colleagues to deliver the best possible care
- Adapted quickly to new procedures and requirements, always prioritizing safety and dignity

I am comfortable with lifting, transferring, and physically supporting individuals as needed, and I am committed to following all protocols to ensure the well-being of those in my care. My experience has taught me the importance of patience, empathy, and teamwork in supporting individuals with diverse needs.

I am eager to bring my skills and dedication to the State of Illinois and contribute to the mission of the Department of Human Services. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can support your team and the individuals you serve.

Sincerely,  
Dawn Zurick Beilfuss
